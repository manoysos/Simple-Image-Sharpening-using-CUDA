# Simple-Image-Sharpening-using-CUDA
A simple program that applies one of two sharpening filters on an image (.pgm files only), using either the cpu or compatible gpus through CUDA.

-baboon.ascii.pgm is the image used for testing.

-baboon.ascii.pgm3x3.pgm and baboon.ascii.pgm5x5.pgm are the results when applying the two different versions of the filter.
